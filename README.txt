The utility file contains an external method for fomatting the data passed for the client's request.
It is made so that data can be handled from sys.argv as separate string arguments, and also so that an
array (polynomial) can be passed directly to the function along with other parameters, such as a,b,
and tolerance.

The polynomial module is included outside of the client/server code and imported.
